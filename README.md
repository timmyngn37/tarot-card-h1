**OVERVIEW**
This project draws inspiration from the MBTI personality test and the Tarot Rider Waite Major Arcana, aiming to provide users with an interactive experience that reveals which Tarot card best aligns with their personality type. The project uses 4 different question banks, each of which has 3 questions. Each question is assigned to one part of the personality, and the personality is concluded after the test is finished. The project prints the results on not only the terminal but also the graphical user interface. Users have a chance to add another person to test or find their past results.
